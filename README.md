## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is [Vinayak Prataap](https://p-vinayak.dev/) (or Vinny) and I am a full-stack developer. I am presently working towards a Computer Science degree (along with a minor in Mathematics) at Seton Hill University. I love full-stack development, DevOps engineering, distributed systems, open-source software, teaching/tutoring, database management, and data science.

I am set to graduate in May 2023 and I am actively seeking new-grad Software Engineer, Software Developer, Data Scientist positions/job opportunities.

#### Development

I have experience in creating full-stack web applications using Laravel (PHP), Flask/Django (Python), NestJS/Express (Typescript/Javascript), HTML/CSS/Javascript, and Databases (MySQL, MS SQL Server, PostgreSQL).

#### Tutoring/Teaching

I have taught several math and physics courses such as general physics, pre-calculus, calculus, and discrete mathematics. I've been a tutor at my university for these courses for around 2 years.

#### Research

I have conducted research as a faculty-selected undergraduate researcher for the mathematics department where I conducted surveys and performed statistical analyses using orange and R language.
